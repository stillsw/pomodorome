stovetimer failed to wake up samsung galaxy nexus... not sure why, it did before, was it only when plugged in, or another keyguard method?
    probably have to call request dismiss keyguard
    
    
next 
    do ticking down display 
        probably fill the extra background arc to show progress
    make a toolbar and other views
    do notifications/alarms
    settings for everything
