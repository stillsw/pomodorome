stovetimer failed to wake up samsung galaxy nexus... not sure why, it did before, was it only when plugged in, or another keyguard method?
    probably have to call request dismiss keyguard
    
bugs
    paused turn orientation, still getting the pause sign problem
    when start app after alarm time has passed the alarm sounds... doTick() is incorrectly testing for a change of minutes
    
next 
    do notifications/alarms
        do stop notification
        and wake up screen
        and setting next alarm
    
    filling the arc of time elapsed, still needs something a bit nicer...
        also how about some kind of path morphing for ticking?

    make sure on tablet, the times are not too small in the middle
        
    make a toolbar and other views
    settings for everything, prompts for rest time 
    
    if move away from using emojis, remove all dependencies etc
        unless allow user to add own rest prompts
    
    launcher icon
    
    ads

    manifest declares app is available for instant... test it works
