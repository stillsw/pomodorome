stovetimer failed to wake up samsung galaxy nexus... not sure why, it did before, was it only when plugged in, or another keyguard method?
    probably have to call request dismiss keyguard
    
bugs
    paused turn orientation, still getting the pause sign problem
    and after pause, then open app from notification (restart, perhaps not when created), the icon is wrongly showing pause symbol while paused
    
next 
    do notifications/alarms
        and wake up screen
            but when user opens the app, the notification is removed... check with intent probably
        
    
    filling the arc of time elapsed, still needs something a bit nicer...
        also how about some kind of path morphing for ticking?

    make sure on tablet, the times are not too small in the middle
        
    make a toolbar and other views
    settings for everything, prompts for rest time 
    
    if move away from using emojis, remove all dependencies etc
        unless allow user to add own rest prompts
    
    launcher icon
    
    ads

    manifest declares app is available for instant... test it works
