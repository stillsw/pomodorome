stovetimer failed to wake up samsung galaxy nexus... not sure why, it did before, was it only when plugged in, or another keyguard method?
    probably have to call request dismiss keyguard
    
    
next 
    do ticking down display 
        not sure about colour of elapsed time arc
    make a toolbar and other views
    do notifications/alarms
    settings for everything
