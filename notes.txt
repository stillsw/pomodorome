stovetimer failed to wake up samsung galaxy nexus... not sure why, it did before, was it only when plugged in, or another keyguard method?
    probably have to call request dismiss keyguard
    

bug 
    starts paused, but button shows pause not play
        there's an issue that the callback fires before the animation completed on the button, 
        animating when pressed works except still wrong icon when it's paused and starts up, shows pause
            also if hit edit button the drawable for play button needs to change to start
    
next 
    shift colours as move from edit to non-edit

    make sure on tablet, the times are not too small in the middle
        
    make a toolbar and other views
    do notifications/alarms
    settings for everything    
    animate the buttons (and icons?)
